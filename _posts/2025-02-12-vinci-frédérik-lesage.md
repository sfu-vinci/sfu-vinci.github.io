**Talk Title**: Reimagining Research Training: Ghost Kitchen Methodology versus Data Fluencies

**Abstract**:  
Research training in academia stands at a crossroads. This presentation explores two divergent approaches to research pedagogy: ghost kitchen methodology and data fluencies.

Drawing on historical and contemporary examples, I argue that ghost kitchen methodology represents a research orientation that prioritizes the development of tools and the treatment of data as ‘raw material.’ This approach emphasizes efficiency, standardization, and instrumental knowledge production—akin to the operations of ghost kitchens in the food industry, which separate production from presentation and broader contextual engagement.

In contrast, data fluencies offer a more holistic approach that acknowledges the interpretive, ethical, and political dimensions of data. Instead of merely processing data, this perspective emphasizes how data circulates, how it shapes and is shaped by society, and how researchers can critically engage with it. The Data Fluencies project, a Mellon-funded initiative led by Prof. Wendy Chun at the [Digital Democracies Institute](https://digitaldemocracies.org/data-fluencies/), exemplifies this approach by fostering interdisciplinary and reflexive modes of inquiry.

The stakes of this pedagogical choice are high: privileging one direction over the other will shape the next generation of researchers and their ability to critically engage with the digital world. Drawing from pragmatist and critical pedagogical traditions, I propose potential solutions through interdisciplinary coursework, such as the newly developed CMNS 858/488 – [Reimagining Data](https://www.sfu.ca/communication/students/current-graduate-students/course-offerings/cmns-858-reimagining-data.html).
