**Title**: We see farther: AI and ML Research at SEED / EA

**Abstract**: Electronic Arts has always been driven by 'We see farther' - a vision of pushing boundaries and exploring new horizons for computer games. At SEED - a pioneering group within Electronic Arts - we combine creativity with applied research. In this talk, I'll share how we get games smarter — by creating characters that feel more alive, generating new worlds on the fly, and making sure the game responds in interesting ways to how players interact with it. You'll get a look at how we're pushing the boundaries of game design and how AI is helping to shape the future interactive entertainment.

**Speaker info**: 
*[Dr. Konrad Tollmar](https://www.kth.se/profile/konrad)* is the Head of Research at SEED Electronic Arts. His research interests include innovative AI for interactive entertainment, computer vision, machine learning, computer graphics, and perception-based human-computer interfaces. Prior to EA, he was an Associate Professor at KTH and headed the Mobile Service Lab, a visiting Professor at TUB Telekom Innovation Laboratories, a faculty member at LU Ingvar Kamprad Design Centre, a Research Scientist at MIT CSAIL, and a Postdoc at MIT AI Lab.

*[Jonas Unger](https://liu.se/en/employee/jonun48)* is professor in computer graphics at the Department of Science and Technology at Linköping University, where he is leading the computer graphics and image processing group consisting of 21 senior researchers, PhD students and research engineers. The vision of the group is to research and develop new theory and technology for computational imaging by fusing computer graphics, computer vision and sensors with human perception and machine learning to capture, digitize and reason about aspects of the world that have not been possible before.
