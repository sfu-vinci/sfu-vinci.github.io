We have [Emily Whiting](https://cs-people.bu.edu/whiting/) from Boston University presenting at our SFU VINCI seminar.

**Date**: Friday, June 9, 2023

**Time**: 11:00 AM - 12:00 PM PST

**Location**: TASC 1 9204, Burnaby campus

**Talk Title**: Computational Fabrication: Design of Geometry and Materials from Simulation to Physical

**Abstract**: Advancements in rapid prototyping technologies are closing the gap between what we can simulate computationally and what we can build. The effect is opening up new design domains for creating objects with novel functionality, and introducing experimental manufacturing processes. My work applies traditional computer graphics techniques, leveraging tools in simulation, animation, and rendering for making functional objects in the physical world. In this talk I will present several lines of inquiry in computational fabrication workflows. On the topic of manufacturing processes I will discuss work on fabric formwork for creating plaster-cast sculptures. In the domain of design I will discuss mechanics-based strategies for custom-fit knitted garments and discovery of 3D printed structures. Finally I will cover developments on design of tactile illustrations for blind and visually impaired individuals for depicting 3D objects.
 
**Biography**: Emily Whiting is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at Boston University. Her research in Computer Graphics combines digital geometry processing, engineering mechanics, and rapid prototyping to explore the development of computational tools for designing functionally-valid and fabrication-ready real world objects. Her lab's work builds on collaborations in a broad range of fields including architecture, human computer interaction, and accessible technologies. She received her PhD from MIT in Computer Graphics and Building Technology. She is the recipient of the NSF CAREER Award and Sloan Research Fellowship. She was General Chair of the ACM Symposium on Computational Fabrication in 2020 and 2021.
