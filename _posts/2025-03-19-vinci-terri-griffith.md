**Talk Title**: Transforming All Our Work With AI

**Abstract**:  
I mean for the title to be as ambiguous as it is. Claude 3.7 Sonnet was able to give me nine different interpretations. ChatGPT 4o offered five, but most with three subheadings. I’m looking forward to sharing my perfectives and frameworks for dealing with this ambiguity, but even more to hearing yours. 

My career focuses on how people come to understand and use new technologies. From designers to implementers to users, we all make decisions about the technology “on the floor” and in our heads (drawing from Weick, Technology as Equivoque, 1990). The VINCI community has what my co-authors and I call “systems savvy,” the ability to see and engage with the world through a sociotechnical lens. Our work shows that this capability is relatively rare (Griffith, Sawyer, & Poole, 2019). My stake is in the ground: for our research, teaching, and support of those outside the university, we must craft our work in new ways. 

**Biography**:  
Terri L. Griffith holds the Keith Beedie Chair in Innovation and Entrepreneurship at Simon Fraser University’s Beedie School of Business. Her research addresses how individuals and groups design, understand, and use new technologies in their work. Her most recent work (funded by Canada’s Social Science and Humanities Research Council) uses large-scale methods to take a “bottom-up” approach to automation and the future of work, including artificial intelligence.
 
Griffith serves as an associate editor for the Academy of Management Annals, is a senior editor for Organization Science, and served a term as associate editor for MIS Quarterly. She is co-editing an upcoming special issue of Small Group Research on Artificial Intelligence and Groups. Her research appears in journals such as Academy of Management Review, Information Systems Research, MIS Quarterly, Organization Science, and the Journal of Organizational Design, where her co-authored work won the 2024 Organizational Design Community-Accenture Annual Prize for Best Practice-oriented Paper.
 
She spent two decades in the Silicon Valley and the Silicon Valley Business Journal recognized her as a Woman of Influence following the publication of her book, The Plugged-In Manager. She was the 2022 President of ISSIP (The International Society of Service Innovation Professionals) and currently serves on the New Ventures BC Society Board of Directors and the advisory board of Geopogo. Her earlier service includes representative-at-large positions for the Academy’s CTO (then OCIS) and TIM divisions.
