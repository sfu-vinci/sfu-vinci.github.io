**Talk Title**: Intrinsic Decomposition and Illumination-Aware Computational Photography

**Abstract**:  
Intrinsic image decomposition aims to separate the surface reflectance and the effects of the illumination given a single photograph. This separation enables physical control over the illumination, enabling many illumination-aware computational photography applications. Our recent work puts forward a physically motivated design of a system of neural networks to achieve high-resolution intrinsic decomposition of photographs in-the-wild. This talk will detail our intrinsic decomposition pipeline and cover its several immediate applications including object relighting and high dynamic range reconstruction.

**Biography**:  
Yağız Aksoy is an assistant professor in the School of Computing Science at Simon Fraser University where he leads the Computational Photography Lab. His work focuses on understanding the physics of a scene from a single view with applications to inverse rendering, realistic image editing, and movie post-production. He received his PhD from ETH Zurich after spending 3 years at Disney Research and a year at MIT CSAIL. His research has led to publications in ACM Transactions on Graphics, SIGGRAPH, CVPR, and ECCV, as well as patent applications, technology transfers, and media coverage including by BBC News and PetaPixel. He has served on the program committees of SIGGRAPH, ICCV, ECCV, and Pacific Graphics.
