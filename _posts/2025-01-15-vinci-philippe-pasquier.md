**Date**: Wednesday, January 15, 2025 

**Time**: 1:30 PM - 2:30 PM  

**Location**: TASC1 9204, Burnaby campus  

**Talk Title**: Creative AI: Opportunities and Challenges in Creative Practices

**Abstract**:  
Creative AI tools increasingly allow for the partial or complete automation of creative tasks. Be it through the augmentation of existing creative software or through embedded real-time generation, these algorithms have a growing influence on creative practices. Creative AI will not take over the world, but it will certainly impact creators, students, educators, and the industry at large.  

Now that generative algorithms have human-competitive skills for many creative tasks and are being deployed for professionals and amateurs alike, it is critical to evaluate and discuss the implications of such developments. We introduce challenges and opportunities arising through a series of examples of generative systems developed at the Metacreation Lab and experiments conducted with these systems. We will introduce a range of tools readily available for computer-assisted sound design, music composition, and visual generation, demonstrate them, and discuss their common implications on creative processes and workflow. We will present results of evaluations conducted with the music software industry focusing on user experience, authorship, ethics, and technological acceptance.

**Biography**:  
Philippe Pasquier is a scientific researcher, multidisciplinary media artist, composer, performer, educator, and a community builder. He is the director of the Metacreation Lab for Creative AI, and a Professor at Simon Fraser University's School for Interactive Arts and Technology (SIAT), in Vancouver (Canada). There, he is pursuing a multidisciplinary research-creation program focused on generative systems and applied AI for creative tasks, computer-assisted creativity, and co-creative systems.  

Along with the Metacreation Lab fellows, Philippe has co-authored over 250 peer-reviewed contributions presented in the most rigorous scientific venues and honored with 8 best paper awards. His MOOC class on Generative Art and Computational Creativity on the Kadenze platform is serving thousands. The Metacreation Lab artistic work has been shown in prominent venues on six continents, including at Ars Electronica, IRCAM, ZKM, Centre Pompidou, Eastern Block, Earzoom festival, several ISEA editions, Mutek Festival, Sydney Biennale, Vooruit, ICST, etc. The Lab's projects are also finding industrial applications and its music AI algorithms have reached millions through open source release of tools, code, datasets, and collaborations with the software industry (e.g., Steinberg, Teenage Engineering, Elias, Microsoft, Huawei, â€¦).
