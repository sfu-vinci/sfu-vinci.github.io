We are excited to announce the creation of VINCI: Visual & INteractive Computing Institute.  The VINCI institute integrates world-class research at SFU on visual-computing (VC), human computer interaction (HCI) and surrounding areas, in alliance with growing tech-hubs in the greater Vancouver area as well as across Canada. The institute consists of the school of Computing Science at the core together with the School of Interactive Arts & Technology (SIAT), the faculty of Communication, Art and Technology (FCAT), the faculty of Arts and Social Sciences (FASS), the Beedie School of Business, the Faculty of Education, the Faculty of Environment, the Faculty of Science, and other schools in the Faculty of Applied Sciences (FAS).

The institute focuses on computing technologies towards the creation, processing, reasoning, display of, and interaction with visual data, as vision represents one of the most pervasive human experiences. The institute creates collective wisdom, helping us to understand how these computing technologies could impact society in a positive way, while mitigating harm to the people of all abilities, genders, races, ages, and backgrounds.
