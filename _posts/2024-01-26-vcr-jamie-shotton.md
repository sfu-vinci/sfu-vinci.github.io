We have [Jamie Shotton](https://jamie.shotton.org/) from Wayve presenting at our SFU VINCI Visual Computing and Robotics (VCR) seminar.

**Date**: Friday, January 26, 2024

**Time**: 12:30 PM - 1:10 PM PST

**Location**: TASC 1 9204, Burnaby campus


**Talk Title**: Frontiers in Embodied AI for Autonomous Driving

**Abstract**: Over the last decade, fundamental advances in AI have driven unprecedented progress across many disciplines and applications. And yet, despite significant progress, autonomous vehicles are still far from mainstream even after billions of dollars of investment. In this talk we’ll explore what’s been holding progress back, and how by adopting a modern embodied AI approach to the problem, Wayve is finally unlocking the potential of autonomous driving in complex and unstructured urban environments such as central London. We’ll also explore some of our latest research in multimodal learning to combine the power of large language models with the driving problem (“LINGO-1”), and in generative world models as learned simulators trained to predict the future conditioned on ego action (“GAIA-1").

**Biography**: Jamie Shotton is a leader in AI research and development, with a track record of incubating transformative new technologies and experiences from early stage research to shipping product. He is Chief Scientist at Wayve, building foundation models for embodied intelligence, such as GAIA and LINGO, to enable safe and adaptable autonomous vehicles. Prior to this he was Partner Director of Science at Microsoft and head of the Mixed Reality & AI Labs where he shipped foundational features including body tracking for Kinect and the hand- and eye-tracking that enable HoloLens 2’s instinctual interaction model. He has explored applications of AI in autonomous driving, mixed reality, virtual presence, human-computer interaction, gaming, robotics, and healthcare.

He has received multiple Best Paper and Best Demo awards at top-tier academic conferences, and the Longuet-Higgins Prize test-of-time award at CVPR 2021. His work on Kinect was awarded the Royal Academy of Engineering’s gold medal MacRobert Award in 2011, and he shares Microsoft’s Outstanding Technical Achievement Award for 2012 with the Kinect engineering team. In 2014 he received the PAMI Young Researcher Award, and in 2015 the MIT Technology Review Innovator Under 35 Award. He was awarded the Royal Academy of Engineering’s Silver Medal in 2020. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering in 2021.
