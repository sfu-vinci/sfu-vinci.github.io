**Date**: Wednesday, March 27, 2024  

**Time**: 12:00 PM - 1:00 PM  

**Location**: TASC1 9204, Burnaby campus  

**Talk Title**: Cross-reality Immersive Visual Analytics

**Abstract**:  
Understanding complex data is challenging. While 2D visualizations are prevalent, research has shown that users can benefit from seeing 3D visualizations for some types of higher-dimensional data. Yet, other types of data are better analyzed in 2D. Given that efficient interaction is a key component of effective visual analytics, I showcase work that presents a new touch-based interface for 2D visual analytics. Then, I discuss visual analytics in 2D and 3D, and several studies that analyze efficient interaction techniques for 3D immersive visual analytics systems.  
Building on this work, I present a new system to support cross-reality immersive visual analytics, where the user can seamlessly transition between analyzing their data in 2D on a desktop monitor and in 3D through a video-see-through AR headset. An initial pilot test indicates positive trends in terms of users' performance time and usability metrics compared to the standalone desktop or AR counterparts. Participants also value the ability to validate insights across 2D and 3D. Finally, I discuss a roadmap towards next-generation immersive visual analytics systems.

**Biography**:  
Wolfgang Stuerzlinger is a Professor in the School of Interactive Arts and Technology at Simon Fraser University and a leading researcher in Virtual Reality, 3D User Interfaces, and Human-Computer Interaction. With a prolific career spanning over 200 peer-reviewed publications, his research focuses on immersive analytics, visual analytics, augmented reality, and interaction techniques. He has made significant contributions to the development of high-dynamic-range displays, 3D interaction methodologies, and responsive GUI layouts, with technologies influenced by his work now widely used in consumer products like TVs, autocorrect systems, and virtual reality devices.
He is recognized for pioneering work in immersive analytics, establishing frameworks for efficient 3D content creation and manipulation, and contributing to the methodologies for evaluating 3D user interface performance.  His leadership extends to co-founding the ACM Symposium on Spatial User Interaction and serving on numerous program committees, including as a program chair for multiple scientific events.
