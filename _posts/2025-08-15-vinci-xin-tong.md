**Talk Title**: Exploring Personalized Learning Approaches for Autistic Children and Key Stakeholders through Generative AI and Game-Based Technologies

**Abstract**:  
In this talk, I will present several research exploring how generative AI and game-based systems can support personalized learning and interventions for autistic children and other stakeholders, e.g., their parents. I will showcase a Minecraft-based game that fosters peer social interaction, a PONG-style tablet game designed to improve turn-taking skills, an AI virtual agent that delivers tailored behavioral training and educational support to parents, and LLM-empowered systems for personalized language and social learning activities in special education. These systems are co-designed with educators and families to embed learning in everyday contexts, aiming to expand access to individualized, context-aware support across home, school, and community settings for autistic education and learning activities.
