**Talk Title**: Designing Inclusive Technologies for Social, Financial, and Digital Engagement

**Abstract**:  
Older adults and people with diverse accessibility needs offer opportunities for new personalized technologies beyond one-size-fits-all solutions. Such interaction design faces unique challenges: the need for technologies that can adapt to varied and evolving user abilities, highly contextualized user needs, and conflicting stakeholder interests compounded by rapidly changing technological landscapes. In this talk, I present my research on supporting aging and accessibility needs in social, financial, and digital engagements where I: 1) diversify sociotechnical design for the dementia community across in-person and virtual settings, 2) innovate accessible computing interventions for aging situated in financial technology landscapes, and 3) advance methodological guidance and tools for inclusive system design.

**Biography**:  
Jiamin (Carrie) Dai is an NSERC Postdoctoral Fellow at UBC Computer Science and holds a PhD from McGill School of Information Studies. Her research innovates inclusive technologies to tackle complex accessibility challenges, such as interactive design supporting older adults in social, financial, and digital engagements. Her work has been published in top-tier ACM human-computer interaction (HCI) venues, including CHI (flagship HCI conference), CSCW (premier conference on computer-supported cooperative work and social computing), and ASSETS (premier accessible computing conference). She has received multiple provincial and institutional doctoral scholarships; her postdoctoral work has been awarded two fellowships (NSERC and AGE-WELL) and a grant (Healthy Aging Research Program), all at the federal level. She has collaborated with researchers beyond her home departments like the University of Toronto Computer Science, McGill Family Medicine, McGill Electrical and Computer Engineering, as well as industry partners from Microsoft Research, Samsung Electronics Canada, and the Bank of Canada.
