**Talk Title**: New Interaction Capabilities with Solid-State LiDAR

**Abstract**:  
As human-computer interaction (HCI) systems increasingly require advanced spatial awareness, next-generation solid-state lidar with software-defined capabilities offers a powerful tool for researchers and developers. This talk will introduce Lumotiveâ€™s Light Control Metasurface (LCM)-based lidar technology, which enables precise, adaptable 3D sensing without moving parts. We will explore how its programmable beam steering and real-time adaptability support a wide range of HCI applications, from gesture recognition to autonomous systems and smart environments. By leveraging the speed, precision, and flexibility of LCM-based lidar, HCI researchers can rethink spatial computing interfaces and develop breakthrough user experiences. The session will conclude with potential research directions and collaborative opportunities for the HCI community to innovate using software-defined lidar in developing next-generation technologies.
