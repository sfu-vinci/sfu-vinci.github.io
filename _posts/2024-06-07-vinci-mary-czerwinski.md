**Location**: Remote


**Talk Title**: Technology for Health and Wellbeing in the Workplace and Home


**Abstract**: How can we create technologies to help us reflect on and potentially change our behavior, as well as improve our health and overall wellbeing both at work and at home? In this talk, I will briefly describe the last several years of work our research team has been doing in this area. We have developed wearable technology to help families manage tense situations with their children, mobile phone-based applications for handling stress and depression, as well as automatic stress sensing systems plus interventions to help users just in time. The overarching goal in all of this research is to develop intelligent systems that work with and adapt to the user so that they can maximize their personal health goals and improve their wellbeing.
